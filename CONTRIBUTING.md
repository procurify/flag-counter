# Contribution Guidelines for Procurify Open Source Projects
Welcome and thank you for considering to contribute to Procurify's open source projects. We appreciate you stopping by and welcome you with open arms to be part of our community.

Please take some time to read the following guidelines we've set to make the contribution process easy and accessible for everyone involved. 

## Code of Conduct
By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/procurify/flag-counter/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting started
Please use the search to see if any exisiting Issues or PRs match your problem before creating your own

We try to resolve issues in a timely manner, but if you feel like your issue is taking too long, feel free to leave a comment or ping a reminder to draw attention

## Issue tracker
If you wish to add changes to the core functionality of the project please email our development team at development@procurify.com

If you find an issue that matches the one you're facing, feel free to comment if your environment differs from the one stated in the issue. Otherwise, adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) is sufficient enough for us to know.

Please follow the steps indicated in our [Issue Tracking Template](https://github.com/procurify/flag-counter/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/issue-report.md) when creating an issue. 

## Pull requests
We welcome all PRs with open arms, just a few guidelines regarding them:
- Utilize the generated PR template
- PRs that address style/whitespace issues should only encapsulate those style changes, otherwise create a separate PR if you are fixing/adding functionality
- Address your issue with as few changed lines as possible

For any large core functionality changes or functionality breaking changes, please email us at development@procurify.com before creating your PR.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

## General questions & reaching out
